Main Menu  You can open the main menu by clicking the toolbar button.        With the sliders on the bottom, you can change the currently displayed epoch (user session) and the latest execution displayed. The epoch shows the number of times a user has created the session and Execution shows the number of times a user has executed the notebook in an epoch.          2. Execution Graph   The nodes in the execution graph denote the cells of a Jupyter Notebook and the edges are the dependencies between cells. Cells that are marked green denote if they have output, red cells denote error or deleted cells, and orange denotes if a data source has been used in the cell or edge.  You can move the nodes in the graph by dragging them to the desired position. By right-clicking and holding, you can open a context menu. You can select an option by moving your mouse to it and releasing the right button.    If you open the menu on a node, you can either open the execution info widget or the code difference widget. If you open it on an edge, you can open the execution info of the represented variable. If you click on a node group, you can focus the corresponding cell in the notebook.     3. Execution info widget   Here you can see all the information about the variables collected in an execution.       4. Code difference widget   Here you can see the changes that were made to the code of a cell in different epochs and executions. On the right side, you see the code of the execution you opened the widget with. On the other side, you can select an older version through the slider on the bottom.       5. Options menu   Here you can select options to show more information on the graph.       6. Environment information   By clicking the button highlighted beneath you can open information about the execution environment of the notebook including the kernel, programming language, and their versions.       7. Import information   Clicking the import info button will open the information about all external modules that were used in the notebook.       8. Code information   The Code information module provides the code along with the output that got executed in your selected epoch in a notebook-styled widget .       9.

2. When looking at the code info tab, it's not immediately obvious what I'm looking at because I don't have a relation between the cells and the outputs that they have. That means that when I'm searching for a specific data point, I have to look through every single cell regardless and there are no headlines to easily get the structure from.
